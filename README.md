2. Navigate to the following folder InstallDir\VersionNumber\scripts\addons. For example: C:\Blender\2.75\scripts\addons
3. Paste the entire io_export_apx folder in that directory.
4. Open Blender.
5. Open File->User Preferences.
6. Under the Addons tab search for HairWorks.
7. Tick the box to enable the addon.
8. Under File->Export "HairWorks (.apx)" should now be visible.

REQUIREMENTS TO EXPORT

1. Have a mesh selected.
2. Triangulate faces.
3. UV unwrap mesh.

4. Buggy when advanced animations or rigs applied.
5. Only one hair particle system exports at the moment.
